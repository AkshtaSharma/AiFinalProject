Sudoku solver for AI final project
We solve Sudoku using backtracking and by combing backtracking and constraint propagation.
PDF file includes details of implementation and some analysis of computational complexity and results. 
Sample Sudoku puzzles used to test & time code are commented out at the bottom of the 2 Python files attached.
